Thus far in 2XC3 I have learned mainly how to use VIM. Vim has been an amazing tool to add to my skillset. Beyond that, I have re-downloaded Ubuntu 24.04 and it has been running so smoothly on my old laptop. 

Learning the commands to manuver around Linux as well as adjusting my OOP assignments has been an amazing learning experience thus far.

I am super excited to fully learn Git for the first time, as I usually use Git desktop.
