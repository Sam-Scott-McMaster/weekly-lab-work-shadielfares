  Introduction to Continuous Integration (CI) environments, focusing on the usage of Linux and C programming for automation and software development.

- **w3: Linux Pipes and Filters**  
  Exploration of Linux pipes and filters, learning how to combine different programs and tools efficiently in the Unix shell.

- **w4: Linux Regular Expressions (Regex)**  
  An in-depth study of regular expressions in Linux, learning how to search, match, and manipulate text using regex patterns.

- **w5: Syntactic Structures in C**  
  Understanding syntactic constructs in C, such as data types, control flow structures, and code organization principles.

- **w6: Recursion in C and Program Structure**  
  Focus on recursion in C programming, including recursive function design and how recursion can affect program structure and performance.

- **w7: Arrays and Pointers in C**  
  Study of arrays and pointers in C, understanding how they work together, memory management, and their applications in software development.

- **w9: Git Branching and C Profiling**  
  Learn about Git branching strategies and techniques for profiling C code to improve performance and optimize resource use.

- **w10: Strings in C**  
  Understanding how strings are handled in C, including string manipulation, memory allocation, and common operations like concatenation and comparison.

- **w11: Linked List**  
  Study of linked lists in C, learning how to implement and manage dynamic data structures that consist of nodes and pointers.

Each week’s folder contains relevant materials such as exercises, code examples, and documentation to help you better understand the topic. Make sure to explore the folder for detailed insights and hands-on coding exercises for each week.
