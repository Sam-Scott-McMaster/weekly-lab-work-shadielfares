I think the main advantage of pointer arithmetic is performance, like since you can directly manipulate the memory and location of the array you need to traverse through.

I think this can be more useful in a large array as you don't have to worry about indexbounds when traversing in a loop, and this saves the compiler time for checking for array bounds.

Disadvantage is that it can lead to harder code to maintain and write, it can confuse developers as the memory access is no longer abstracted out.

This becomes ever more challenging in a large codepsace and the possibiliy of dereferencing null or invalid pointers leading to undefined behaviour and hard bugs to solve.
