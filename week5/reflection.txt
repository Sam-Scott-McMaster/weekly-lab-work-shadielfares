Honestly, I would never use this language. 

So overly complicated for no reason, like Python EVEN JAVA is so much more intuitive than this.

I would honestly, rather write in Lisp than intialize one more string as an array of characters.

Modern programming doesn't have to be harder than it already is and I would advice junior programmers to spend their time learning system design, even digital logic to better understand low level programming.

Benefit: 
	C can allow you to manage memory more practically and hands on than other languages allow one to do.

Disadvantage:
	Overly complicated and unintuitive syntax. The memory leaks return no useful error, so you are just kind of lost if you don't know how to manage it.

Python all day baby.
